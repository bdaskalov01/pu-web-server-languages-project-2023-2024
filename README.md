KNOWN BUGS AND HOW TO FIX THEM:
1. BUG: Holidays or Reservations not showing up even tho they are created. (Rare)
   SOLUTION: Delete every row from each table (Including locations) and start creating everything again. (Works every time.)
2. BUG: Reservation's customer name and/or phone number doesn't change after editing it (Happens everytime, not sure if it's a bug or it just works this way)
   SOLUTION: Click the "Search" button again after editing the details so the reservation shows up again, this time displaying the updated customer name and phone number.
